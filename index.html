							<li>Evidence-based policymaking (EBP) has become valuable to policymakers.</li>
							<li>Researchers use data visualizations (DVs) to communicate their messages.</li>

						<li>Research Purpose</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Demonstrate power of DVs, using data from multiple sources.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>In the last few decades, evidence-based policymaking has become an important topic in the conversations among government departments, research organizations, and think tanks.</li>
						<li>Evidence-based policymaking utilizes evidence from research to inform the policymaking process, which brings about social, economic, and fiscal benefits.</li>
						<li>Data visualization is the use of electronic tools to promote accurate comprehension of data.</li>
						<li>Researchers can create data visualizations to communicate their messages about health, social, and economic policy issues in developing countries.</li>
						<li>In this paper, we aim to demonstrate the power of data visualizations as an evidence-based approach to policymaking.</li>
						<li>To that end, we created static and interactive visualizations of data from multiple sources, including survey data, census, and administrative records.</li>
						<li>We discussed the way in which data visualizations may help the United Nations and non-governmental agencies develop evidence-driven decisions for sustainable development programs.</li>

							<li>Our main sources of data were the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals Indicators, and the World Bank’s Open Data. We also incorporate data from other sources, such as the DPRK 2008 Census as applicable.</li>
							<li>We continued a team effort from last year and applied the principles of DVs as offered in a paper co-authored by our team members. We used statistical tools such as R and Tableau to create DVs, including static and interactive DVs.

						<ul>
							<li>Social benefit: by collecting high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of social programs. </li>

							<li>Fiscal benefit: shutting down ineffective programs will help reduce debts in the long run.</li>

							<li>The power of EBP lies in its methodical approach to policymaking, an approach that rendered opinion-based policymaking ineffective. According to the literature, this advantage of EBP over the obsolete opinion-based policymaking could be shown in three aspects: social, economic, and fiscal benefits.</li>
							<li>First, the social benefit of EBP could be reaped by collecting high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of social programs. Scientifically rigorous evaluations of programs would reveal programs that work, as well as those that fail. Policymakers can then eliminate programs with mediocre results, and expand programs that are effective.</li>
							<li>Second, expanding effective social programs will in turn lead to significant economic results. For example, if we expand programs that has empirically improved the education of low-income children, we will eventually close the income-based academic-achievement gaps, and fully utilize any untapped human potential. Utilizing the human resources will lead to faster economic growth.</li>
							<li>The third benefit of EBP is the fiscal benefit. In 2015, the U.S. federal government owed more than $18.1 trillion in debt (Muhlhausen, 2015). Replacing ineffective programs with effective ones will reduce government spending and debts. Shutting down ineffective programs will improve the allocation of scarce federal resources, and help reduce debts in the long run.</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Data visualization can be understood as the use of electronic tools to promote accurate comprehension of data.</li>
							<li>Under this definition, the role of data visualization is two-fold. First, it helps viewers achieve a clear understanding of the data. Second, it is researchers’ instrument to communicate their messages about the data to the viewers.</li>
							<li>In view of the aforementioned role of data visualization, we present several principles of data visualization, which were discussed by author Stephen Few in his article “Information Visualization, Design, and the Arts: Collision or Collaboration”. We illustrate these principles by examples of DVs that we came across during our lit review.</li>
							<li>We apply these principles in our research, so that our data visualizations facilitate understanding of data from the UN.</li>

					<h3>Quantitative values should be displayed using the lengths of simple, two-dimensional objects.</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>First, viewers can easily understand quantitative values if they are displayed using the lengths of simple, two-dimensional objects, such as bars.</li>
							<li>This method prompts the human mind to make comparisons on a one-dimensional plane (the lengths) while objects are presented on a two-dimensional surface.</li>
							<li>On the contrary, angles and areas require the human brain to make two-dimensional comparisons in a two-dimensional presentation; therefore, they tend to make it more difficult for viewers to decode the visualizations.</li>
							<li>For example, “North Korea Tuberculosis” displays the presence of TB in the DPRK in 1990-2012 using a simple bar graph.[1] The difference in the lengths of the bars stands out, immediately drawing the viewers’ attention to the rapid increase in TB prevalence in the DPRK.</li>

						<ul>
							<li>Maternal mortality was chosen as an indicator for the health of a set of vulnerable women.</li>
							<li>I thought this data point would show a certain trend that could serve as the basis of my research question.</li>
							<li>This particular set of box graphs shows the maternal mortality ratio of developing and developed countries in 5 year intervals, from 1990 to 2015.</li>
							<li>The colors were added in order to help see the different years throughout the presentation.</li>
							<li>As expected, developing countries had a lower maternal mortality rate.</li>
							<li>The developing countries definitely had worse maternal mortality across the years.</li>
							<li>Still, there was less of a difference on average.</li>
							<li>There may have been a range of countries within developing countries, but the average improved over time.</li>
							<li>The progress made every five years is apparent.</li>

							<li>Whereas primary education increasingly became a given, secondary education was thought to more realistically depict the state of women’s education on basic levels.</li>
							<li>Gender Parity Index describes a ratio, so closer to 1.0 means that men and women are equally represented.</li>
							<li>A value larger than one means that women are better represented, and a value less than one means that men are better represented.</li>

						<ul>
							<li>Proportion of seats held by women in national parliament was chosen because political power is considered the highest level of women’s empowerment in the UN,</li>
							<li>The UN has five sets of data regarding female empowerment: girls in primary school, girls in secondary school, girls in tertiary or higher education, women in non-agricultural sectors of occupation, and women in national parliament,</li>
							<li>This particular indicator was initially chosen to see whether slow progress for women was due to lack of political representation on their behalf,</li>
							<li>However, the lesson that I took away from this actually was more oriented towards developed countries,</li>
							<li>Regarding women in parliament, the range was large on both sides, and overall developed countries have made much more progress that developing countries over the years,</li>
							<li>In 1990, there was a definite difference seen between developing and developed countries, although developed countries did have a huge range,</li>
							<li>However, over the years the developing countries have pretty much caught up with developed countries in some cases, although the overall average is slightly lower and there is a huge range,</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>The data for maternal mortality, girls in secondary education, and women in parliament was initially used to try to show trends that would help explain trends in developing countries.</li>
							<li>However, I found the data more important in handing developed countries and how evidence-based policymaking could become more effective.</li>
							<li>First of all, within every indicator there were a couple countries that were statistically outliers.</li>
							<li>These countries were the ones bringing down world average.</li>
							<li>These countries would have to be focused on more than others in the future.</li>
							<li>Second of all, within the “developing country” category, there was a huge range.</li>
							<li>Some countries had proportion of seats in national parliament held by women that were equal to or greater than the proportion of most developing countries.</li>
							<li>Therefore the umbrella term “third world country” or “developing countries” no longer seemed to be a great method of approaching improvement of the world.</li>
							<li>Third of all, developed countries have to work on their empowerment of women.</li>
							<li>Relative to the advances in health and education, women are not seeing proportionate involvement in government and politics.</li>
							<li>This societal problem is one that the developing country is falling behind on, and must focus on in the future.</li>
							<li>Although the trends seen were not expected, the data has shown tangible results that policymakers can use as guidance in making more informed decisions.</li>

							<li>In the previous DV series, we mentioned that citizens of Ryanggang have the worst health conditions but appear immobile. We plotted global chronic malnutrition in children aged 24-59.9 months as a heat map.</li>

							<li>Takeaway:  provinces with the worst malnutrition, namely Jagang and Ryanggang, appear isolated. These provinces have little migration, and their citizens mainly migrate to Pyongyang. A pressing observation arises: citizens of these areas are suffering from stunting, yet they are unable to escape that situation.</li>

							<li>Malnutrition in children can have damaging long term consequences, as it affects the future generation of a nation. In the interactive visualization “Scaling Malnutrition to the DPRK”, we allow users to choose to display chronic or acute malnutrition (or both) on a map of the  DPRK.</li>
							<li>Chronic malnutrition, or Stunting (red). The prevalence of chronic malnutrition were scaled against the total landmass of each province. Three levels of stunting are displayed, severe being the darkest shade of red, followed by moderate, and global has the lightest shade of red. Scale the coordinates of each province boundary by the square root of the prevalence of each province.</li>
							<li>Wasting (blue).  Prevalence of wasting is also displayed as land areas. Three levels of severity of wasting are displayed: the deepest shade of blue is severe, followed by moderate, and global has the lightest shade of blue.</li>
							<li>Takeaways: first, Each type of malnutrition takes up a considerable amount of the landmass in each province (show red, then blue). Thus we should treat malnutrition for all provinces, not just the capital.</li>
							<li>second, global and moderate acute malnutrition show very little difference (show blue). The boundaries of global and moderate wasting almost perfectly coincide. A child that is afflicted with global acute malnutrition is actually already under moderate acute malnutrition. The implication of this trend is significant for non-governmental organizations and humanitarian efforts: In order to tackle acute malnutrition, we must simultaneously face global and moderate cases.</li>

						<li>In general, the undernourished population has decreased over time.</li>
						<li>In 2015, there were still countries whose undernourished population falls between 40% and 60%. This is an alarmingly high number and effort needs to made to improve the situation in these countries.</li>
						<li>Most of the countries with high undernourished population are in Africa. Policymakers could invest resources in Africa to improve the issue of undernourishment.</li>
						<li>When observed over time, some countries fluctuate in their undernourished population. Policymakers might wish to investigate the reasons for the fluctuation and work to ensure sustainable development.</li>
