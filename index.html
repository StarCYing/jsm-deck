						<li>Advantage of EBP: its methodical approach to policymaking</li>
						<li>The advantage of EBP could be shown in three aspects:</li>

							<li>fiscal benefit</li>
						</ul>

						<ul>
							<li>The power of EBP lies in its methodical approach to policymaking, an approach that rendered opinion-based policymaking ineffective. According to the literature, this advantage of EBP over the obsolete opinion-based policymaking could be shown in three aspects: social, economic, and fiscal benefits.</li>
							<li>First, the social benefit of EBP could be reaped by collecting high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of social programs. Scientifically rigorous evaluations of programs would reveal programs that work, as well as those that fail. Policymakers can then eliminate programs with mediocre results, and expand programs that are effective.</li>
							<li>Second, expanding effective social programs will in turn lead to significant economic results. For example, if we expand programs that has empirically improved the education of low-income children, we will eventually close the income-based academic-achievement gaps, and fully utilize any untapped human potential. Utilizing the human resources will lead to faster economic growth.</li>
							<li>The third benefit of EBP is the fiscal benefit. In 2015, the U.S. federal government owed more than $18.1 trillion in debt (Muhlhausen, 2015). Replacing ineffective programs with effective ones will reduce government spending and debts. Shutting down ineffective programs will improve the allocation of scarce federal resources, and help reduce debts in the long run.</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Data visualization can be understood as the use of electronic tools to promote accurate comprehension of data.</li>
							<li>Under this definition, the role of data visualization is two-fold. First, it helps viewers achieve a clear understanding of the data. Second, it is researchers’ instrument to communicate their messages about the data to the viewers.</li>
							<li>In view of the aforementioned role of data visualization, we present several principles of data visualization, which were discussed by author Stephen Few in his article “Information Visualization, Design, and the Arts: Collision or Collaboration”. We illustrate these principles by examples of DVs that we came across during our lit review.</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>First, viewers can easily understand quantitative values if they are displayed using the lengths of simple, two-dimensional objects, such as bars.</li>
							<li>This method prompts the human mind to make comparisons on a one-dimensional plane (the lengths) while objects are presented on a two-dimensional surface.</li>
							<li>On the contrary, angles and areas require the human brain to make two-dimensional comparisons in a two-dimensional presentation; therefore, they tend to make it more difficult for viewers to decode the visualizations.</li>
							<li>For example, “North Korea Tuberculosis” displays the presence of TB in the DPRK in 1990-2012 using a simple bar graph.[1] The difference in the lengths of the bars stands out, immediately drawing the viewers’ attention to the rapid increase in TB prevalence in the DPRK.</li>

					<h2>Malnutrition in Central America and its Relationship to Key Health Conditions</h2>

							<li>For my research question, I decided to focus on Malnutrition, Incidence of Tuberculosis and the Maternal Mortality Ratio particularly in Central America. I wanted to see whether or not there was a correlation between malnutrition and key health conditions, assess how different countries’ health conditions changed over time with the implementation of MDGs, and offer how health policy in Central America should be changed in the future.</li>

Underweight and Stunting are two indicators that the World Health Organization uses to assess malnutrition.</li>
							<li>We can see that Honduras, the purple line, has the highest drop in percentage, Costa Rica, the dark blue line, has the lowest percentages overall, and Guatemala, the green line, has the highest percentages overall.</li>
							<li>The black line, which represents the average percentages for the Latin America & Caribbean region, is only above the percentages for Costa Rica, and closely follows the pink line that represents Panama.

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>It seems there is no direct correlation between malnutrition and key health conditions such as incidence of tuberculosis and maternal mortality ratio, because DVs I developed did not factor into the potential effect of time-lag between a potential cause and effect. I discovered interesting trends that were apparent and, for the most part, consistent  in each of the data visualizations.</li>
							<li>First of all, Costa Rica consistently had the lowest percentages, incidences, and ratios of negative health conditions. All of the health indicators, except for Percentage of Underweight Children had a steady decreasing trend. This may be due to the fact that Costa Rica is largely regarded as having the most stable and most democratic government among the Central American countries. https://www.britannica.com/place/Costa-Rica</li>
							<li>This type of government allowed for the people’s voices to be heard and for a universal health care system to be established and then reformed in the 1990s with a larger emphasis on expanding coverage. Additionally, Costa Rica has a policy that focuses on human development and therefore the health of its population. http://www.who.int/healthsystems/topics/financing/healthreport/CostaRicaNo11.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2376989/</li>
							<li>Additionally, Honduras experienced a reform in its health system beginning in 1990 as well as , which may explain the steep drop that is shown in each data visualization. The reform aimed for a more progressive integration of the public insurance of the country, and that the population has access to timely and quality health services. http://www.paho.org/PAHO-USAID/dmdocuments/Health_System_Profile-Honduras_2009.pdf</li>
							<li>Looking at both Costa Rica and Honduras, it seems that health care systems that focus on spreading coverage and providing quality basic health services through public insurance seem to work and help improve the health of the population. Policymakers could research further into these two countries’ health systems and see why their reforms worked and use them as examples for other nations.</li>
							<li>Countries like Guatemala, which consistently had the highest prevalence in regards to malnutrition, and was still fairly high in incidences of tuberculosis and maternal mortality ratio, have health systems with high levels of private expenditure and unequal access to healthcare facilities. http://www.who.int/countryfocus/cooperation_strategy/ccsbrief_gtm_en.pdf</li>
							<li>Nicaragua also has an issue with rural regions having less access to healthcare facilities, and thus the population in rural regions have worse health. Therefore, this is an indicator that unequal access to health care facilities need to be eliminated. http://www.fsdinternational.org/country/nicaragua/healthissues</li>
							<li>When we look at the data visualizations as a whole, we notice that some countries are consistently in worse health conditions compared to the other countries, and also typically when one health indicator is bad, the rest are bad as well. This is an implication that countries such as Nicaragua and Guatemala, the two countries that seem to be faring the worst out of this group of countries, need to be focused on to protect the health of the population.   We recommend UN health organizations, medical NGOs and developed countries in North America provide due attention and viable resources to help Nicaragua and Guatemala to improve their public health infrastructure. Communicable disease like TB knows no borders.</li>

							<li>Chronic malnutrition, or Stunting (red). The prevalence of chronic malnutrition were scaled against the total landmass of each province. Three levels of stunting are displayed, severe being the darkest shade of red, followed by moderate, and global has the lightest shade of red. Scale the coordinates of each province boundary by the square root of the prevalence of each province.</li>
							<li>Wasting (blue).  Prevalence of wasting is also displayed as land areas. Three levels of severity of wasting are displayed: the deepest shade of blue is severe, followed by moderate, and global has the lightest shade of blue.</li>

							<li>second, global and moderate acute malnutrition show very little difference (show blue). The boundaries of global and moderate wasting almost perfectly coincide. A child that is afflicted with global acute malnutrition is actually already under moderate acute malnutrition.
